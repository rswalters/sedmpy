Documentation for SEDM Software
===============================

The documentation is based on sphinx v1.3+.  Be sure you have this installed (if you use Ureka, you will).  To generate the documentation, cd into kpy/docs and execute:

    #> make clean
    #> make html

The index for this html document tree is then located in sedmpy/docs/build/index.html.
